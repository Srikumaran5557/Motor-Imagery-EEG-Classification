# 📈 Results and Evaluation

## 🧪 Evaluation Protocol

* Train on **42 subjects**
* Test on **10 unseen subjects**
* Measure cross-subject generalization

---

## 📊 Metrics Meaning

### ✔️ Accuracy

Overall correct predictions.

---

### ✔️ Precision

Correct positive predictions among predicted positives.

---

### ✔️ Recall

Detection rate of true motor imagery class.

---

### ✔️ F1 Score

Balance between precision and recall.

---

### ✔️ Cohen’s Kappa

Agreement beyond random chance.

---

## 🧠 Expected Behavior

CSP features capture contralateral sensorimotor activation patterns, enabling discrimination between left and right motor imagery.

---

## ⚠️ Variability Factors

Performance varies due to:

* Subject EEG differences
* BCI illiteracy
* Noise/artifacts
* Trial variability

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

* ICA artifact rejection
* Frequency-band CSP
* Deep learning models
* Subject adaptation
